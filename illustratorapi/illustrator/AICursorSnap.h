/** @ingroup Suites
	Tools that use the Smart Guides snapping facility use these
	functions in the cursor-tracking code. The suite provides functions
	for snapping the cursor to various things, called \e constraints.
	Constraints include art objects, page boundaries
	and the automatically generated guide lines. You can also define your own
	constraints, using \c #SetCustom(), although most tools do not do so.

	@note Turning on the grid turns smart guides off, so you never use
	this facility to snap to the grid.

	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAICursorSnapSuite and \c #kAICursorSnapVersion.

	Snap the cursor using the \c #Track() function, which
	takes a current cursor location and returns the snapped location.
	A control string contains a series of Smart Guide commands
	that control how the snap is performed; that is, what kind of
	object is snapped to, and what kind of location to look for in
	each kind of object.

	You can find out what object is under the snapped location:
@code
AIHitRef hit;
long option = <<whatever options>>
result = sAIHitTest->HitTest(NULL, &p, option, &hit);
if (result)
	throw ai::Error(result);
@endcode

	These are the control strings used by the various tools built
	into Illustrator, as saved in the preferences file.
	The first entry in each line is the key used in preferences. The second
	is the control string for when the mouse is up and the third is the control
	string for when the mouse is down.

	- "Select", "A v o f", "ATFGP v i o f"
	- "RangeSelect", "", ""
	- "Zoom", "", ""
