/** @ingroup Suites
	Use these functions to manage the application context. The application
	context does two things:

	\li It establishes the current document and view. Most SDK
	functions do not take a document or a view as a parameter, but
	use the current document or view as defined by the application context.

	\li It establishes the scope of a single undoable operation. All the
	changes that occur during a single application context are grouped
	together into a single operation, which can then be undone and redone.

	Most plug-ins will not need to use these functions because Illustrator
	manages the context. In rare situations, however, a plug-in may need
	to make changes to the context. For example, if a plug-in can
	be called directly by the operating system, Illustrator will not have
	established the context. If the plug-in wants to make SDK calls
	in response, it should use \c #PushAppContext() and \c #PopAppContext().

	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAIAppContextSuite and \c #kAIAppContextVersion.
