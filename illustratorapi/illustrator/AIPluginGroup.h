/** @ingroup Selectors
	Notifies a plug-in group of edits to the edit group.
	An \c #AIPluginGroupMessage::code value indicates the
	type of editing operation being performed. An
	\c #AIPluginGroupMessage::time value indicates what stage of
	the operation is in progress.

	When the handler returns \c #kNoErr, the plug-in object is marked
	as "dirty" (in need of \c #kSelectorAIUpdateArt). To prevent this,
	return \c #kMarkValidPluginGroupReply. If the handler returns
	\c #kDontCarePluginGroupReply, retains the state of the object,
	and does not mark it as clean or dirty.

	If the handler returns \c #kWantsAfterMsgPluginGroupReply from a
	\c #kBeforeOperationTime notify-edits message, a single
	\c #kAfterOperationTime message is sent at the end of the transaction,
	just before the Undo recording is closed, and before the update message.
	The code is \c #kChangeOperationCode, regardless of whether a more
	specific code was sent at \c #kBeforeOperationTime).
	This is the appropriate place to make any changes to the edit art.

	@note An edit to children of the edit art does NOT always send a
	notify-edits message, although every edit sends an update message.
	Notify-edits is meant for highly structured objects where
	the different descendants have specific roles to play in the plug-in.
	Basic edits that are likely to require a specific response from plug-ins
	trigger the notify-edits message. Changes that are harder to generalize
	trigger only the update message.
	<br><br>
	For blend objects, for example, moving a spine point should cause
	the objects to move onto the spine, but moving a blend component should cause
	the spine point to move with the art object. Looking only at the post-edit
	state of the edit art, it would be hard to detect the difference between those
	two edits, since in both of them the only easily detected discrepancy, without
	knowing which paths were edited, is that the art elements are off the spine. */

/** @ingroup Selectors
	Asks a plug-in group to interpolate plug-in data and dictionary contents
	when interpolations are made into a blend between plug-in groups.
	@see \c #kPluginGroupBlendAsPluginGroup

	Uses \c #AIPluginGroupMessage::time to indicate what stage of
	the operation is in progress. Not sent at \c #kCheckOperationTime, but you
	can use the \c #kBeforeOperationTime message to check whether the operation is allowed.

	At all stages, \c #AIPluginGroupMessage::preEditArt is the plug-in group being
	blended from (the one closest to t=0), and \c #AIPluginGroupMessage::postEditArt
	is the plug-in group being blended to (the one closest to t=1).

	\c #AIPluginGroupMessage::art is only used at \c #kDuringOperationTime.

	When the stage is \c #kBeforeOperationTime:
		\li If the plug-in returns \c #kRefusePluginGroupReply,
			the interpolated steps are ordinary groups blending the result groups,
			just as if the \c #kPluginGroupBlendAsPluginGroup option was off or the
			plug-in groups were of different classes. No further messages are sent.
			This lets the plug-in decide whether the two groups are blendable as plug-in
			groups based on their data or contents.
		\li If the plug-in returns \c #kDontCarePluginGroupReply, the edit groups
			are blended, then the \c #kSelectorAIUpdateArt message is sent.
			There are no \c #kDuringOperationTime or \c #kAfterOperationTime messages.
			The intermediate objects are of the same plug-in group class.
			Their plug-in data and dictionary contents are duplicated from
			the \c postEditArt object. <br>
			This reply is meant for plug-in groups that do everything identically
			for all of their objects and do not	need any extra data. It could also
			be returned when the plug-in determines	that the two objects
			have the same data.

		\li If the two plug-in groups are blendable as plug-in groups,
			and you need to interpolate their data, set up any data you
			will need for the \c #kDuringOperationTime	messages, then return
			either \c #kNoErr or \c #kWantsAfterMsgPluginGroupReply.

	The \c #kBeforeOperationTime message is the time to do anything
	that you want to do only once per blend, instead of once per step,
	such as finding and recording the commonalities, differences, and
	blendable aspects of the two objects. This temporary data can be
	stored in \c #AIPluginGroupMessage::AIInterruptData, or attached to the
	\c preEditArt and \c postEditArt objects.

	The \c #kDuringOperationTime message is sent only when the \c #kBeforeOperationTime
	message returns either \c #kNoErr or \c #kWantsAfterMsgPluginGroupReply. For each step,
	Illustrator creates a plug-in group of the same class, blends the edit group contents
	as if they were ordinary groups, and passes that interpolated object in
	\c #AIPluginGroupMessage::art (which is used only at this stage).
	<br> \c #AIPluginGroupMessage::t indicates which step has been reached.
	The interpolated objects are created with empty dictionaries
	and no plug-in data. This is the time for the plug-in to attach any
	interpolated data.

	The \c #kAfterOperationTime message is sent after all the interpolated steps
	have been created, if \c #kWantsAfterMsgPluginGroupReply was returned from any of the
	\c #kBeforeOperationTime or \c #kDuringOperationTime notifications. It
	gives you a chance to release any data you have set up.

	Any reply other than these is treated as an error and causes the blend
	not to be created at all.

/** @ingroup Selectors
	Asks a plug-in group to collect the paint styles of all objects

	Sent if the \c #kPluginGroupManagesPaintStyles option flag is on.
	Your handler iterates the art styles or path styles in plug-in group art to a
	callback function, which can examine, but not modify the art styles and art objects.

	Call the desired callback function repeatedly until either all the relevant styles
	have been iterated,	or until the callback returns an error or \c #kIterationCanQuitReply.
	Return this as the result of the notification.

	Use to process information about style-related attributes of
	selected objects, such as fill or stroke attributes, when the styles do not map
	directly onto the styles of selected objects within the edit group.
	A stroke style, for example, might apply only to certain bezier segments
	and not to an entire path.You can keep styles in a dictionary, along with
	information about parts of the edit group and/or result group to which those styles apply.

	You can iterate partial styles to privately accumulate a report for multiple objects.
	Invalid fields, as identified by the style map, are considered \e mixed in the plug-in group.
	For example, if \c fillPaint is false in the style map, it means that some
	potentially-fillable contents are filled, and some are not filled.
	If it is difficult or time-consuming to determine which styles
	correspond to selected objects, you can privately cache the results of an accumulated style and
	style map, and call the path-style callback only once with those cached results. Clear the cache
	on a selection-changed or properties-changed notifier.

/** @ingroup Selectors
	Asks a plug-in group to apply a developer-defined color-mapping
	callback function to objects for which it privately manages styles or colors.

	Initiated by plug-ins or other system components that want to alter all the colors
	in a collection of objects. Your handler must iterate through the colors within
	the plug-in group that fit the request, passing them to the supplied callback.

	The message data, \c #AIPluginGroupAdjustColorsData, contains three callback procedures,
	for colors, styles, and patterns. Your handler must execute the proper callback
	on each data entry of the appropriate type that contains meaningful colors; that is,
	those that can affect the colors in the result art.

	\li If the plug-in group contains art objects with meaningful colors in its dictionary or
		plug-in group data, (for example,the content art of Envelope objects in Edit Envelope mode),
		call \c #AIPathStyleSuite::AdjustObjectAIColors() for those objects, passing in the
		\c #AIPluginGroupAdjustColorsData::adjustColorCallback and
		\c #AIPluginGroupAdjustColorsData::callbackData.

	\li You need not process art objects whose colors are ignored in building the result art;
		for example, the gradient mesh that defines the distortion in an Envelope object.

	For private color data not contained in an \c #AIArtHandle, choose the callback
	that most directly matches the data types the plug-in stores. For example, if it
	stores an \c #AIArtStyleHandle, use the style callback, rather than attempting
	to iterate the colors in the art style.

	If the option \c #kPluginGroupManagesPaintStyles is on for the plug-in, the handler
	for this message performs the entire adjustment for the plug-in group. If the option is off,
	the colors in the edit group are further processed after this handler
	completes, unless your handler returns \c #kSkipEditGroupReply.

	To initiate this request to a plug-in group that your plug-in does not manage,
	call \c #AIPluginGroupSuite::PluginArtAdjustColors().

/**	@ingroup Suites
	This suite provides functions for working with \e plug-in \e groups.

	A plug-in group organizes artwork that is acted upon by a particular plug-in.
	A plug-in group object is a container of plug-in group art objects.
	It maintains two groups of art objects; one group that the user interacts
	with (the \e edit \e group), and another group that your plug-in generates
	(the \e result \e group). Use the functions in this suite to create
	these groups and to access their contents.

	Register a plug-in group during startup to manage plug-in group art objects
	of a particular type, using \c #AIPluginGroupSuite::AddAIPluginGroup().
	Store the returned plug-in group handle in \c globals, to use in
	creating plug-in group art objects. All plug-in group art objects
	must associate themselves with a plug-in group by calling
	\c #AIPluginGroupSuite::UseAIPluginGroup().

 	A plug-in group art object is an art object with the type \c #kPluginArt. The
 	edit art group and result art group are art objects with the type
	\c #kGroupArt, but they are not children of the plug-in group art object.
	Access them with \c #AIPluginGroupSuite::GetPluginArtEditArt() and
	\c #AIPluginGroupSuite::GetPluginArtResultArt().
		\li Members of the edit group are hidden, but are editable and selectable.
		\li Members of the result group become visible, but are not selectable.

	You can define and store arbitrary data with a plug-group art object, using
	\c #AIPluginGroupSuite::SetPluginArtDataRange(),
	\c #AIPluginGroupSuite::GetPluginArtDataRange(),
	\c #AIPluginGroupSuite::SetPluginArtDataCount(),
	and  \c #AIPluginGroupSuite::GetPluginArtDataCount().

	A plug-in that manages plug-in groups can receive these selectors,
	with \c #kCallerAIPluginGroup as the caller, accompanied by
	an \c #AIPluginGroupMessage:
	<br> \c #kSelectorAINotifyEdits
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIUpdateArt
	<br> \c #kSelectorAICanShowContents
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIInterpolateData

	It can also receive these selectors:
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIReplaceSymbol (sends \c #AIReplaceSymbolMessageData)
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIDisallowsArtTypeQuery (sends \c #AIPluginArtTypeMessageData)
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIPerformCustomHitTest (sends \c #AIPluginGroupCustomHitTestData)
	<br> \c #kSelectorAICollectPaintStyles (sends \c #AIPluginGroupCollectPaintStylesData)
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIApplyPaintStyles (sends \c #AIPluginGroupApplyPaintStylesData)
	<br> \c #kSelectorAIAdjustColors (sends \c #AIPluginGroupAdjustColorsData)

	The Live Blend tool is an example of how plug-in groups are used.
	A live blend is created by drawing two objects, then clicking them
	separately with the blend tool. After the second click, the tool draws
	a series of intermediate objects between the original source and destination
	objects to create a smooth blend between them. Only the source and destination
	objects are selectable or editable. When you edit or move the source or
	destination objects, the intermediate objects are regenerated. The document
	contains only the original two objects in the art tree.
	In this case, the source and destination art objects (as well as the spine
	which links the two objects) are children of the edit group, and the intermediate
	objects (as well as a copy of the original source and destination objects) are
	children of the result group.


  	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAIPluginGroupSuite and \c #kAIPluginGroupVersion.

	@section Plug-in Group Example

	First, register the plug-in group:

@code
sAIPluginGroup->AddAIPluginGroup (
	message->d.self,
	"My Plugin Group Plugin",
	&pluginGroupData,
	kPluginGroupWantsAutoTransformOption,
	&g->myPluginGroupHandle
	);
@endcode

	Create the plug-in group art, typically in response to a menu item or a click
	in your dialog, then associate the plug-in group art with the plug-in group.

@code
sAIArt->NewArt( kPluginArt, kPlaceAboveAll, NULL, &pluginGroupArt );
sAIPluginGroup->UseAIPluginGroup (pluginGroupArt, g->myPluginGroupHandle );
@endcode

	This activates the plug-in group art and allows you to access
	its edit and result groups.

	Upon activation, your plug-in starts to receive notifications.
	In response to \c #kSelectorAIUpdateArt or \c #kSelectorAINotifyEdits
	notifications, you must regenerate the objects in the result group
	The update message is the easiest and most effective notifier to use.
	It is sent whenever any of the edit-group objects are modified.
	In your main loop, listen for the \c #kCallerAIPluginGroup caller
	and \c #kSelectorAIUpdateArt selector and respond by regenerating the
	result-group objects according to the new state of the edit-group objects.

		\c #kPluginGroupManagesPaintStyles, should now use \c #AIPathStyleSuite::AdjustObjectAIColors()

		the previous behavior; it sends an c\ #AIPluginGroupAdjustColorsData
		message in which both the pattern and style adjustment callbacks do nothing.

		Modifies colors in all art managed by a plug-in group, by calling a developer-defined callback function.

				colors were modified.
			@param adjustFills True to modify colors in fill.
			@param adjustStrokes True to modify colors in strokes.
			@param selectionOnly True to modify colors only in selected objects.
			@return Any error reported by the callback function.
			@note This function s intended for the use of plug-ins \e other \e than
