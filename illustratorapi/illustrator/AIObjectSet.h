 /** Object sets are deprecated in favor of dictionaries,

	@internal
 	An object map is a set of type/offset pairs giving the location of each object handle
 	in the object definition.  It is terminated by an entry with <code>objectType = kAIObjectMapDone</code>.
 	An entry can be \c NULL for a particular instance, which indicates that although some
 	instances of the type store an object handle there, this particular one does not.
 	If the map says there is an object of a given type at a given offset, the data at
    that offset must be either a valid object handle of the appropriate type, or \c NULL.
