/** @ingroup Suites
	This suite provides functions that allow you to examine and manipulate
	\e paths, which are art objects of type \c #kPathArt.

	The shape of a path is defined by one or more path \e segments.
	Every segment of a path corresponds to an \e anchor \e point, which is
	the handle shown when the path is selected. The number of anchor points
	on a path, or \e segment \e count, includes the two at each end.
	A segment is defined by the \c #AIPathSegment structure. Segment
	index numbers begin at zero. A path can have a single anchor point.

	The \e in and \e out points of a segment define the tangent of the curve
	at a point \e p. The in point is not used for the initial and final segments
	of an open path. A segment can be a \e corner point or a \e smooth point.
	For a corner, the in and out points can be anywhere. To make a straight line,
	place the in and out points of each end on their p points.

	A path can be can be \e closed or \e open.
	If a path is open, it is defined only by its segments. If it is closed,
	Illustrator draws a segment between the first and last anchor points,
	which uses the out tangent of the last segment and the in tangent of the first.

	Some paths are also used as \e guides. In all other respects they are paths,
	with the same contents and attributes. Paint attributes are associated with
	a path through a \e path \e style. See the \c #AIPathStyleSuite.

  	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAIPathSuite and \c #kAIPathVersion.
