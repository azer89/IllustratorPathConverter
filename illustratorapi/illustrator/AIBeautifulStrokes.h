	One way to use this suite is to create a BeautifulStrokes params dictionary,
	add the stroke settings to the dictionary, then use that dictionary to apply
	the settings to source art. This generates new art in a destination group.
	For example:

	@code
	void Fn(AIArtHandle srcPath, AIArtHandle dstGroup)
	{
		AIDictionaryRef params = 0;
		sAIBeautifulStrokes->CreateParamsDict(NULL, params);
		sAIBeautifulStrokes->SetDashAdjustment(params, true);
		sAIBeautifulStrokes->GenerateArt(params, srcPath, NULL, TRUE, dstGroup, NULL);
		sAIDictionary->Release(params);
	}
	@endcode

	Counted object note: Suite functions that return counted object types such as
	\c #AIDictionarySuite::AIDictionaryRef and \c #AIArraySuite::AIArrayRef increment
	the reference count and the caller must release unneeded references to avoid memory
	leaks, as shown in the examples. Documentation for individual parameters mentions those
	that are reference counted and need to be released. See also \c #AICountedObjectSuite
	and the \c ai::Ref C++ class.

	The example above uses the \c #AIDictionarySuite::Release() directly.
	The following example uses the \c ai::Ref C++ class to manage the counted
	object. (Note that \c #AICountedObjectSuite::Release() is equivalent to
	\c #AIDictionarySuite::Release()):

	@code
	void Fn_Ref(AILiveEffectParameters effectParams)
	{

		that is, they do not appear in the Symbols panel. The symbols are parsed to determine the alignment
		parameters and the default scale.

		Any unpainted closed rectangle in the back of the symbol definition is ignored and stripped from
		the art that is used to determine the "tip" of the arrow and placed on the path. These unpainted
		rectangles are assumed to be only for the purpose of making the symbol thumbnails a uniform size.

		Arrowhead art inside the symbol is assumed to be positioned the way it would be when applied as an
		end arrow to a horizontal open path that started at the left and ended at the right.
		If applied as a start arrow, it is reflected horizontally before it is applied.

		If there is a stroked open straight line in the back of the symbol definition (either above or below
		the bounding rectangle if there is one), then the right endpoint of that line is used to specify the
		truncation point. If it additionally has an internal anchor point, the furthest right such anchor point
		is used to specify the attachment point, otherwise the attachment point is the same as the truncation point.

		The tip is treated as the point along the right edge of the bounding box (after removing the bounding tile,
		if any) which is at the same height as the positioning line. The stroke weight of the positioning line
		is used to determine the default scale of the arrowhead. For example, if the positioning stroke is 2 pts, then
		the arrowhead is scaled 50% when it is applied to a path with a 1 pt stroke, and scaled 150% when it
		is applied to a path with a 3 pt stroke. The begin-scale or end-scale factors are applied additionally.

		If there is no positioning line, the default is to use a 100% default scale; that is, to treat the symbol
		as if it were scaled appropriately for a 1 pt line, and to put both the attachment and truncation points
		in the center of the symbol.

	/**	Retrieves the left, right, and combined widths of the focal stroke at a fraction of the distance along a path,
		and reports the source of the widths.
		The widths are analogous to the stroke weights as returned by the \c #AIArtStyleSuite::GetPaintAttributes().
		As such, they include the stroke weight scaling, but do not include the impact of pattern or art brush
		scale options or pattern or art brush tile sizes.

		@param path				[in] The path to be examined for width data.
		@param lengthFraction	[in/out] Upon input, the fraction of the path length at which the width is being queried.
								Upon output, if the width source is \c #kCenteredProfileMark or \c #kUncenteredProfileMark, the
								possibly snapped position of that mark. To find whether snapping has occurred,
								cache the original length fraction and compare it to the returned value.
		@param tolerance		[in] If positive and the path has a user-specified variable width profile,
								and the input length fraction is within this tolerance of one of the t values in the
								width array, then the length fraction is snapped to that t value. If zero
								or negative, a tolerance of .001 is used.
		@param totalWidth		[out][optional] A buffer in which to return the total width at the given position,
								as obtained from the width source.
		@param leftWidth		[out][optional] A buffer in which to return the stroke width on the left side of the path
								at the given position, as obtained from the width source.
		@param rightWidth		[out][optional] A buffer in which to return the stroke width on the right side of the path
								at the given position, as obtained from the width source.
		@param widthSource		[out][optional] A buffer in which to return the width-source constant. It will be one of kConstantWidth, kTabletData,
								kCenteredProfileMark, kUncenteredProfileMark, kCenteredProfileInterpolation, kUncenteredProfileInterpolation.
		@param markerIndex		[out][optional] A buffer in which to return the marker index. If width source is from a centered
								or uncentered profile, the index into the parallel t and width arrays of the marker.
								For \c #kCenteredProfileMark and \c #kUncenteredProfileMark,
								it is the index of the marker at that location; for \c #kCenteredProfileInterpolation and
								\c #kUncenteredProfileInterpolation, it is the index of the preceding marker.
		@param markerDetails	[in/out][optional] On input, the only meaningful flag values are \c #kIncomingWidthMarker and
								\c #kOutgoingWidthMarker. These specify which of the two markers should be returned in
								the event that there are two markers at exactly the input length fraction. (If snapping
								occurs, then the flags are ignored; the incoming marker is returned when
								it snaps upward, and the outgoing when it snaps downward.) If null
								or if neither or both of those flags are on, and there are two markers
								at exactly the input length fraction, then the larger of the two is returned.
								On output, if  width source is \c #kCenteredProfileMark or \c #kUncenteredProfileMark, can
								contain one of \c #kIncomingWidthMarker or \c #kOutgoingWidthMarker, and/or \c #kCornerWidthMarker.
