/** @ingroup Suites
	This suite provides functions that allow you to access and modify \e swatches and
	\e swatch \e lists.	Each Illustrator document has an associated swatch list
	which contains the document’s color swatches as shown in the Swatches palette.

	You can use \c #GetSwatchList() or functions from the \c #AISwatchLibrariesSuite
	to obtain a swatch list reference. Typically, however, you need  only
	the current document's swatch list, so for convenience all functions that take an
	\c #AISwatchListRef accept \c NULL to indicate the current document's
	swatch list.

	The elements in a swatch list are of type \c #AISwatchRef. A swatch is
	an \c #AIColor and an associated name. For \c #AIColor types that are themselves
	defined by a named object (custom colors, patterns and gradients) the swatch name
	is always the same as the name of the object. For other types of \c #AIColor,
	the swatch name is independent.

	Swatch lists are hierarchically organized into \e swatch \e groups,
	which can be named; see the \c #AISwatchGroupSuite.  In \c #InsertNthSwatch(), an
	index of -1 inserts at the end of the general swatches group (group 0).
	Accessor functions in this suite treat groups as if they were flattened,
	so that an index of 0 is the first swatch in the first group, and index numbers
	simply continue into the next group. An exception is the deprecated \c #GetNextSwatch(),
	which works only within a group. Use \c #GetNthSwatch() instead for iteration.

	There are three notifiers associated with swatch lists:
	<br> \c #kAISwatchListChangedNotifier
	<br> \c #kAISwatchListChangedInternallyNotifier
	<br> \c #kAISwatchReplaceColorNotifier

  	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAISwatchListSuite and \c #kAISwatchListVersion.

/** @ingroup Suites
	Swatch lists are hierarchically organized into \e swatch \e groups,

	the groups, and explicitly control the group placement of swatches within the list.

	in this group, whose index is 0.

	Other groups are explicitly created and named, and can restrict the types of
	swatches that belong to them. The first such group is at index 1.
