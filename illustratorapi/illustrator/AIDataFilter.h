/** @ingroup Suites
	A data filter is an object that bytes of data can be read from or written to.
	The filter usually does something interesting with those bytes. For example,
	it might write them to a disk file, send them over a network or it could
	perform JPEG encoding and decoding.

	This suite provides functions to create filters that read and write files, buffers,
	or memory blocks, and that encode/decode and compress/decompress data.

	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAIDataFilterSuite and \c #kAIDataFilterVersion.

	Data filters can be linked together. Each filter in the linked chain gets data from
	or puts data to the previous filter. A file filter could, for example, be linked
	to an ASCII encoding filter which is in turn linked to a binary compression filter.
	The result is a composite filter that compresses and ASCII-encodes data before writing
	it to a file.

	The following code shows how to set up a data filter that performs buffered
	writes to a file. Note that \c #LinkDataFilter() must be called even for the
	first filter as it initializes the filter.
@code
AIErr result = kNoErr;
AIDataFilter* dstfilter = NULL;
AIDataFilter* filter;
if (!result)
	result = sAIDataFilter->NewFileDataFilter(file, "write", 'ART5', 'TEXT', &filter);
if (!result) {
	result = sAIDataFilter->LinkDataFilter(dstfilter, filter);
	dstfilter = filter;
}
if (!result)
	result = sAIDataFilter->NewBufferDataFilter(32*1024, &filter);
if (!result) {
	result = sAIDataFilter->LinkDataFilter(dstfilter, filter);
	dstfilter = filter;
}
@endcode

	When you have finished with a filter, you can use the following code to close it.
@code
AIErr result = kNoErr;
while (dstfilter)  {
	AIErr tmpresult = sAIDataFilter->UnlinkDataFilter(dstfilter, &dstfilter);
	if (!result)
		result = tmpresult;
}
@endcode
