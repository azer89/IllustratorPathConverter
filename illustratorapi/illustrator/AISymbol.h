/** @ingroup Suites
	This suite is always available. The functions allow you to query and manipulate
	the symbol patterns and symbol instances in a document.	 Symbol instances
	are art objects of type \c #kSymbolArt, and are associated with a transformation
	matrix.

	These notifiers are related to symbols:
	<br> \c #kAIArtSymbolSetChangedNotifier
	<br> \c #kAIArtSymbolSetDetailedChangeNotifier

	These dictionary keys are related to symbols:
	<br> \c #kAISymbolToSelectDictKey

	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAISymbolSuite and \c #kAISymbolVersion.

	@section ListedUnlistedSymbols  Listed and Unlisted Symbols

	\li Listed symbols appear in the Symbols palette, and  are saved when a document
	is closed, even if there are no instances of them in the document. They can be considered
	public, shared between documents.

	\li Unlisted symbols do not appear in the Symbols palette. When the document
	is saved, they are not written out unless there is at least one instance of the symbol
	used in the document. Unlisted symbols can be considered private to a specific document.

	Ordering of the global symbol list affects only listed symbols. When you retrieve
	unlisted symbols, their order is usually, but not always, that of creation.
	The position index is not guaranteed to remain constant between calls.

	Unlisted symbols are intended for instances that are automatically
	generated in a context where they are not directly selectable, such as the result group
	of a plug-in art object (for instance, the intermediate steps of a blend or the particles
	of a particle system), or the styled art of an object with a complex appearance.
	They are systematically derived by the plug-in group or a Live Effect from one
	or more listed symbols.

	Symbol instances that appear in ordinary selectable contexts should always be
	based on listed symbols, but they do not become listed automatically. Any
	command that expands objects like plug-in groups or appearances should call
	\c #MakeSymbolPatternListed() on any symbols used by instances in the expanded art.
	It is not necessary to first call \c #IsSymbolPatternListed(); if the symbol is already
	listed, the call does nothing.

	Unlike art styles, for which being unlisted is tied to having an anonymous name
	(see \c #AIArtStyleSuite), an unlisted symbol can have any name. When you create
	unlisted symbols, you should give names that will make sense if they later become listed,
	so that Expand commands do not need to rename them without sufficient context.
	To avoid name conflicts, use names that are unlikely to be chosen by a user.

	For example, if a particle system or brush generates unlisted symbols by
	tinting listed symbols, it can use names like 'Snowflake autotinted
	10Y' and 'Snowflake autotinted 8C 5M', where Snowflake is the name of the listed
	symbol, and the word 'autotinted' is in a string resource that can be
	localized. Using 'autotinted' instead of simply 'tinted' decreases
	the likelihood that a user would coincidentally assign that name to a listed
	symbol.
